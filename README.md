Hi Guys

My name is Christiano Sinaga

Currently i'm still a student at Surabaya State University (Universitas Negeri Surabaya), majored in Informatics Engineering.
I have interest in Web & Software Development. I made a couple software in my study at university, and now i'm studying Web Development.

In my previous software development project, i use Java as my main language and with the help of JavaFX. I also programmed simple database that were used in the software.

Here are my previous projects :
